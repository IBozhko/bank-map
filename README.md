# bank-map

That is a project i made couple of years ago, which i will call version 1. Will make some changes, so it gets safer to use.
A really simple bank console app, uses java.util.HashMap to store data as well as some OOP principles(encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction). Also working on adding polymorphism. All version changes will be done in master branch.

Version 1 relies on user to know what type of data to use and doesnt verify data integrity, or catch any exceptions, this will be changed.
